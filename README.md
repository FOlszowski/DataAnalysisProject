Data analysis for given set of measurements can be very helpful to understand certain phenomenons from found correlations. However, another use of statistic modeling is to create a model from given samples and make predictions from it. In our project, we created two models with the same parameters to compare differences and see how different approaches lead to different results. 
Topic of our project is Polio disease, specifically paralysis cases. We will make predictions for three diferent time slots to see how models behave with different sets of data.
